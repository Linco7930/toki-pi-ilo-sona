# toki pi ilo sona
toki a!

This is the specification for toki ilo (language of tools), a programming language that tries to retain the grammatical features and words of toki pona, while still retaining the look of a programming language. This sometimes comes at the cost of practicality, but I doubt you’re using a toki pona programming language for practicality.

Here is an example of what a Hello World program could look like.

```
pali wawa li ni:
  o toki e nimi "toki a!".
  o pana e nanpa 0.
.
```
Output: "toki a!"

Unfortunately I will most likely have to pick either UCSUR compatible or latin compatible, and I’m going to use latin so the most people possible can use the language. I may get to making it UCSUR compatible as another version of the language after I am done with the latin script version.

# Thank you's
Currently I want to thank FulinS, my coding friend, for helping me figure out a few confusing statements.
